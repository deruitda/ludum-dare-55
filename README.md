# Hades' Haunted Corn Maze

Hades' Haunted Corn Maze is a tower defense game with a twist, you must solve mini text puzzles to complete a summoning ritual to summon your defenses.

## Lore 
Hades' is a washed up loser who is not taken seriously any longer. He now owns and operates a series of Haunted Experiences for mortals to enjoy in the above world. He attracts mortals by offering a cash prize to each person who can make it through his Haunted Experiences, however they risk their own Souls by participating. Hades will Summon some of his Monsters to keep mortals from finishing the Haunted Experience, Monsters can kill a Human releasing their soul to Hades. If enough mortals make it through the Haunted Experience, they will bankrupt Hades and he will be a bigger loser.

## Gameplay

The player plays as Hades and manages the Haunted Experience. Hades will start the game with no Souls, and a full Bank. He can summon various Monsters using his Summoning Scroll. As mortals enter the Haunted Experience, they must be stopped by Hades' Monsters from completing the Haunted Experience. Each Monster will have abilities with different effects and ranges to kill the mortals. Killing a Human adds one Soul to Hades' Soul Jar. If a Human makes it through the maze, $X (the survival reward) will be deducted from Hades' Bank account (think of it as a health bar). If enough mortals make it through the maze to reduce Hades' bank account to $0, the level will be over and Hades will be bankrupt. If Hades is able to stop all the mortals and still have money leftover, the player wins the level.

### Summoning
 Hades can choose from an array of Monsters to summon, each one costing a different number of Souls to summon. After selecting a Monster to summon in the UI, the player will then select a destination for the Monster on the map, then the player will have to perform a summoning mini game. The mini game will consist of potentially randomized text based mini games, where the player must recite (type on their keyboard) some text from the Summoning scroll for that Monster. Once the player completes the mini game,the Monster will be summoned at the destination set earlier. There _may_ be a cap on the number of summons allowed for a Monster. 

### Summoning Example:

To summon a Minotaur Monster, the player will select the Minotaur's icon, and then select a destination for the Minotaur, then the Summoning Scroll will change to display Ritual Text. The Ritual Text must be recited (typed on the keyboard) by the player in the input box on the scroll. The Minotaur's Ritual Text could state: "Up Up Left" or "ruatoniM" (Minotaur backwards), there will be many different mini games. Hades will recite that Ritual Text, if done correctly the book will flash green and the Monster will be Summoned at the chosen location. If done incorrectly, the book will flash red and Hades can try again, or cancel the summon and choose something else.
