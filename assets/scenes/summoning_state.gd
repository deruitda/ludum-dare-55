#  The code is pretty simple. We have a state machine with three states: IDLE, CHOOSING_LOCATION, and SUMMONING. The state machine is controlled by the  set_state  function, which sets the current state to the one passed as an argument. 
#  The  _on_monster_selected  function is called when a monster is selected. If the current state is IDLE, the state is set to CHOOSING_LOCATION, and the monster is saved in the  summoning_monster  variable. 
#  The  _on_location_selected  function is called when a location is selected. If the current state is CHOOSING_LOCATION, the state is set to SUMMONING. 
#  The  _on_monster_summoned_successfully  function is called when the monster is summoned successfully. If the current state is SUMMONING, the state is set to IDLE. 
#  The  _on_monster_summoned_failed  function is called when the monster summoning fails. If the current state is SUMMONING, the state is set to IDLE. 
#  The  reset_state  function is used to reset the state machine to the IDLE state. 
#  The  _on_monster_selected ,  _on_location_selected ,  _on_monster_summoned_successfully , and  _on_monster_summoned_failed  functions print the current state of the state machine. 
#  Now, letâ€™s create the signals that will be used to communicate between the different nodes. 
#  Create the signals 
#  In the  SummoningSignal  script, add the following code: 
#  extends Node
